# Textbook Review

* It looks like people who review textbook are either on the end of the positive spectrum or negative spectrum. It's not often that people with neutral feeling toward the textbook would spend the time to review.

* It's interesting that Watson interpreted this following passage as neutral:

"First of all, the statistical part of machine learning is JUST a real subset of mathematical statisitcs, whatever Bayesian or frequentist. Secondly, the non-statistical part of machine learning is not systematic or well developed yet.We have used it as a textbook for a half-year course of Machine Learning. I think[1] this book is a collection of many methods from Pattern Recognition, Statistics, Coding Theory, etc.[2] anyone who wants to make clear the algorithms of EM, ME, etc, DO NOT read this book.[3] it is suitable for undergraduate students in light of its simple mathematics.[4] the examples in this book are very very naive."

The second the third queries for the aggregations allow users to know which book receive the most positive and negative reviews. In addition, the text is returned, so users dive deeper if they want to learn why a textbook is given such review.
